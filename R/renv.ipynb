    "`renv` is a package management system for R that helps ensure reproducibility and portability of R projects. It allows you to create isolated environments for your R projects, making it easier to share and collaborate on code. The documentation is available at: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id='toc1_2_'></a>[Why should you use renv?](#toc0_)\n",
    "For different analysis you might rely on various R packages. However, managing package versions and dependencies can be challenging. Here's why `renv` is a good practice for biologists:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reproducibility: `renv` allows you to capture the exact versions of R packages used in your project. This ensures that your code can be reproduced in the future, even if new package versions become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Collaboration: With `renv`, you can more easily share your R projects with colleagues or collaborators. They can set up the same environment using the `renv.lock` file, ensuring that everyone is working with the same package versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Avoid conflicts: By using isolated environments `renv` makes it easier to avoid conflicts between different package versions, ensuring that your code runs consistently, even if you need to update a package for another analysis.\n"

    "Here are some reasons why you should always be using R Projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Organization: R Projects help you keep all related files in one place. This makes it easier to manage your scripts, data, and outputs, ensuring that your work is well-organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reproducibility: R Projects ensures that your working directory is set correctly every time you open the project. This helps avoid issues related to file paths and makes your analysis reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Collaboration: R Projects make it easier to collaborate with others. By sharing the project folder, your collaborators can easily access all the necessary files and run the analysis without any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Version Control: R Projects integrate seamlessly with version control systems like Git. This allows you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate more effectively with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Environment Management: R Projects allow you to manage your R environment more effectively. You can use packages like `renv` to create isolated environments for each project, ensuring that package versions and dependencies are consistent.\n",
